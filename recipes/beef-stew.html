    <h1>Beef Stew</h1>
    <img src="beef-stew.jpg">
    <p>This Guinness beef stew is a very simple dish, but at the same time, it has a deep, complex, rich flavor. The maltiness of dark beer really does amazing things for the gravy. I served this in a nice ring of green onion-mashed potatoes. I hope you give this a try, whether for Saint Patrick's Day or any time of the year.</p>
